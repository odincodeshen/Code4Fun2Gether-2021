microbit collaborative learning program

Two months ago, I heard a concept called "collaborative learning" which is the educational approach of using groups to enhance learning through working together. As a father and a maker, I'm interested in using the concept of younger people coding education for my and colleaguess' kids. Thanks for #TeamArm support; we organized meaningful #microbit code club at our Taipei office.

We encourage the parents to sit with kids together to realize their idea in the tiny #microcontroller. I start by arousing kids' curiosity first, then guide them on exploring each fundamental coding block. Incredible result in the course even though I don't give them example code, most families can find out how to finish each small program. Amazing.

Many of the kids keep coding their idea on the board after the event, super impressive. It's great exercise for next phase volunteer activities. :)
